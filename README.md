# Game-of-Life-GA
Final Project for 6205
We use Jenetics Library find the best starting pattern for game of life. With generating random initial genotype,  
the initial genotype will go through mutator and crossover process. Selector in Jenetics library will select the 100 highest score of fitness function. The best starting pattern and its every generatio will show in GUI.
The program will pause when you close GUI.
